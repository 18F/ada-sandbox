When state or local governments, businesses and nonprofit organizations provide customer or employee parking in parking lots or garages, accessible parking spaces complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) must be provided.

Accessible parking spaces are different than traditional parking spaces. They have specific features that make it easier for people with disabilities to access your programs, goods or services.

## Features

### Location

In parking lots or garages, accessible parking spaces must be located on the shortest accessible route to the accessible entrance. An accessible route is the path a person with a disability takes to enter and move through a building or facility.

### Access Aisle

Accessible parking spaces must have access aisles. Access aisles provide a designated area for people who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices to get in and out of their car or van. Mobility devices allow people with disabilities to move about independently. Devices include but are not limited to walkers, canes, crutches, braces, manual or power wheelchairs, Segways and electric scooters.

#### Access aisles must be:

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6">
      <ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="access-aisles-must-be">
        <li>{% include yes.html %} Marked (to discourage parking in them)</li>
        <li>{% include yes.html %} The same length as the space it serves</li>
        <li>{% include yes.html %} Level with the parking space it serves</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6"><img src="{{ 'assets/img/project-images/aisle-parking.png' | relative_url }}" alt="A van-accessible parking space sharing an access aisle with an accessible parking space for a car" /></div>
  </div>
</div>

Two parking spaces can share an access aisle (except in angled parking).

Access aisles can be placed on either side of the parking space (except in angled parking).

### Parking Spaces

Accessible parking spaces must be provided for cars and vans.

#### Car accessible spaces must:

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6">
      <ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="car-accessible-spaces-must">
        <li>{% include yes.html %} Be at least 96 inches wide</li>
        <li>{% include yes.html %} Have an access aisle at least 60 inches wide</li>
        <li>{% include yes.html %} Have no more than a two percent slope in all directions</li>
        <li>{% include yes.html %} Have a surface that is firm, stable and slip-resistant</li>
        <li>{% include yes.html %} Have a sign with the international symbol of accessibility on it, mounted at least 60 inches above the ground (measured to the bottom of the sign)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <div class="tablet:grid-col-6"><img src="{{ 'assets/img/project-images/car-accessible.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Accessible parking spaces with 60-inch minimum width access aisle for cars" /></div>
  </div>
</div>

#### Van accessible spaces must:

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6">
      <ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="van-accessible-spaces-must">
        <li>{% include yes.html %} Be at least 96 inches wide</li>

        <li>{% include yes.html %} Have a surface that is firm, stable and slip-resistant</li>
        <li>{% include yes.html %} Have two signs, mounted at least 60 inches above the ground (measured to the bottom of the sign)</li>
        <li>{% include yes.html %} First sign - international symbol of accessibility</li>
        <li>{% include yes.html %} Second sign - stating that the space is van accessible</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <div class="tablet:grid-col-6"><img src="{{ 'assets/img/project-images/van-accessible.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Minimum 96-inch wide van-accessible parking space with 96-inch minimum width access aisle" /></div>
  </div>
</div>

## Calculating Accessible Parking Spaces

The number of accessible parking spaces must be considered separately for each parking facility, not based on the total number of parking spaces provided on a site.  

The chart below shows the number of accessible spaces required by the [2010 Standards](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm%23c2).


<table class="usa-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Total number of parking spaces provided in a parking lot or facility.</th>
      <th scope="col">Minimum number of
accessible parking spaces permitted.</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1 to 25</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">26 to 50</th>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">51 to 75</th>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">76 to 100</th>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">101 to 150</th>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">151 to 200</th>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">201 to 300</th>

      <td>2 percent of total</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1001 and over</th>
      <td>20, plus 1 for each 100, or fraction thereof, over 1000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">One of every six spaces must be van accessible.</th>
      <td></td>

## Special Parking Conditions

### Limited Parking

Where parking spaces are limited to four or fewer spaces:

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6">
      <ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="access-aisles-must-be">
        <li>{% include yes.html %} One van accessible parking space must be provided</li>
        <li>{% include no.html %} Not required to have a sign with the international symbol of accessibility</li>
        <li>{% include yes.html %} Anyone can park in that space</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6"><img src="{{ 'assets/img/project-images/limited-spaces.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Front of a convenience store with four parking spaces, one parking space is a van-accessible space" /></div>
  </div>
</div>
