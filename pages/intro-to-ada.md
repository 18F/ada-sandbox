The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in everyday activities. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability just as other civil rights laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, and religion. It guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else to enjoy employment opportunities, purchase goods and services, and participate in state and local government programs. 

## The ADA Protects People with Disabilities 

A person with a disability is someone who:
 
- has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, 
- has a history or record of such an impairment (such as cancer that is in remission), or 
- is perceived by others as having such an impairment (such as a person who has scars from a severe burn).
 
If a person meets this definition, the ADA protects them. Because the ADA is a law, and not a benefit program, you do not need to apply for coverage. 
 
<details>
  <summary>What does <dfn><i>substantially limits</i></dfn> mean?</summary>
  <p>The term “substantially limits” is defined broadly and is not meant to be a demanding standard. An example of a condition that is not substantial is a mild allergy to pollen.</p> 
</details>  
 
<details>
<summary>What does <dfn><i>major life activities</i></dfn> mean?</summary>
 
<p>Major life activities are the kind of actions that you do every day, including your body’s own internal processes. There are many major life activities in addition to the examples listed here. Some examples include:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Actions like eating, sleeping, speaking, and breathing</li>
  <li>Movements like walking, standing, lifting, and bending</li>
  <li>Cognitive functions like thinking and concentrating</li>
  <li>Sensory functions like seeing and hearing</li>
  <li>Tasks like working, reading, learning, and communicating</li>
  <li>Regular function of bodily systems like circulation, reproduction, and individual organs</li>
</ul>
</details>

### Examples of Disabilities
 
There are many disabilities, and the ADA does not list all of them. Some disabilities may be visible, and some are not. Some examples of disabilities include:
 
- Cancer
- Diabetes
- Post-traumatic stress disorder
- HIV
- Autism
- Cerebral palsy
- Deafness 
- Blindness
- Epilepsy
- Mobility disabilities such as those requiring the use of a wheelchair
- Intellectual disabilities
- Major depressive disorder
- Traumatic brain injury

## The ADA Prohibits Disability Discrimination in Many Areas of Life

To prevent discrimination against people with disabilities, the ADA sets out requirements that apply to most of the organizations and situations you encounter in everyday life. Employers, state and local governments, businesses that are open to the public, commercial facilities, transportation, and telecommunications all have to follow the requirements of the ADA. 

<details>
  <summary>The ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability</summary>

<p>Under the ADA, it is illegal to discriminate against someone because of their disability.</p> 

<p>For example, a local rec center might only be open to people who live in the surrounding zip code. If the rec center refused access to a person with epilepsy because that person lived in a different zip code, that would not be a violation of the ADA because the rec center would not be discriminating on the basis of the person’s disability.</p>
</details> 

The ADA is broken up into five different sections, which are called titles. Different titles set out the requirements for different kinds of organizations. For example, title I of the ADA covers requirements for employers, and title II covers requirements for state and local governments. You can find the relevant title of the ADA noted next to each type of organization below. 

### Employment (Title I)

**Applies to:** employers that have 15 or more employees.

**Note:** When serving the public, all businesses, regardless of their size, must still provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to access the business’s goods and services. Read more about these requirements under the section for Businesses that are open to the public below.

**General requirement:** Employers must provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from the employment-related opportunities available to others. This includes things like recruitment, hiring, promotions, training, pay, and social activities. 

**If you have a complaint:** [File a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission](https://www.eeoc.gov/filing-charge-discrimination).

### State and Local Government Services (Title II)

Examples of state and local government activities include:  
- Public education 
- Employment
- Transportation
- Recreation
- Health care
- Social services
- Courts
- Voting
- Emergency services
- Town meetings

The ADA applies to state and local governments even if:
- the state or local government is small or
- they receive money from the federal government.

**General requirement:** State and local governments must provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from all of their programs, services, and activities. 

**If you have a complaint:** [File a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm).

**General requirement:** public transit systems must provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from their services. 

**If you have a complaint:** [File a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm) or [with the Federal Transit Administration](https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/civil-rights-ada/file-complaint-fta).

<details><summary>Some areas of life are not covered by the ADA or are covered by other laws</summary>
<p>Although the ADA applies to many areas of life, it does not cover everything. In some situations, disability discrimination is prohibited by laws other than the ADA.</p>

<p>While the ADA applies to certain types of housing (e.g., housing at private and public universities and public housing programs), the Fair Housing Act applies to almost all types of housing, both public and privately owned, including housing covered by the ADA.</p>

<ul><li>If you have a complaint about disability discrimination under the Fair Housing Act: <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/online-complaint">File a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development</a>.</li></ul>

<p>Disability discrimination during air travel is prohibited by the Air Carriers Access Act.</p>
<ul><li>If you have a complaint about disability discrimination during air travel: <a href="https://airconsumer.dot.gov/escomplaint/ConsumerForm.cfm">File a complaint with the Department of Transportation’s Office of Aviation Consumer Protection</a>.</li></ul>

<p>While religious organizations are exempt from the requirements of title III of the ADA, they would be subject to the employment obligations of title I if they have enough employees to meet the requirements for coverage. Additionally, religious groups or organizations may still have to comply with accessible building codes or other state or federal laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability.</p>
</details>

### Other Important Requirements (Title V)

The ADA also includes other requirements for how to implement the law. 

Examples of these requirements include:
- Prohibiting retaliation against a person who has claimed their rights under the ADA.
- Stating that a person with a disability is not required to accept an aid or accommodation if they do not want to. 
- Authorizing courts to award attorneys’ fees to the winning party in a lawsuit under the ADA.
- Directing certain federal agencies to issue guidance explaining the law. 

### Federal Agencies’ Roles 

Many federal agencies are responsible for enforcing the ADA and other laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. These agencies receive complaints, conduct investigations, and issue regulations and guidance to explain the law.
