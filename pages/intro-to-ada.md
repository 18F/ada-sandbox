The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in everyday activities. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability just as other civil rights laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, and religion. It guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else to enjoy employment opportunities, purchase goods and services, and participate in state and local government programs. 

## The ADA protects people with disabilities 

A person with a disability is someone who:
 
- has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, 
- has a history or record of such an impairment (such as cancer that is in remission), or 
- is perceived by others as having such an impairment (such as a person who has scars from a severe burn).
 
If a person meets this definition, the ADA protects them. Because the ADA is a law, and not a benefit program, you do not need to apply for coverage. 
 
<details>
  <summary><em>Substantially limits</em> defined</summary>
  <p>The term “substantially limits” is defined broadly and is not meant to be a demanding standard. An example of a condition that is not substantial is a mild allergy to pollen.</p> 
</details>  
 
<details>
<summary><em>Major life activities</em> defined</summary>
 
<p>Major life activities are the kind of actions that you do every day, including your body’s own internal processes. There are many major life activities in addition to the examples listed here. Some examples include:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Actions like eating, sleeping, speaking, and breathing</li>
  <li>Movements like walking, standing, lifting, and bending</li>
  <li>Cognitive functions like thinking and concentrating</li>
  <li>Sensory functions like seeing and hearing</li>
  <li>Tasks like working, reading, learning, and communicating</li>
  <li>Regular function of bodily systems like circulation, reproduction, and individual organs</li>
</ul>
</details>

### Examples of disabilities
 
There are many disabilities, and the ADA does not list all of them. Some disabilities may be visible, and some are not. Some examples of disabilities include:
 
- Cancer
- Diabetes
- Post-traumatic stress disorder
- HIV
- Autism
- Cerebral palsy
- Deafness 
- Blindness
- Epilepsy
- Mobility disabilities such as those requiring the use of a wheelchair
- Intellectual disabilities
- Major depressive disorder
- Traumatic brain injury

## The ADA prohibits disability discrimination in many areas of life

To prevent discrimination against people with disabilities, the ADA sets out requirements that apply to most of the organizations and situations you encounter in everyday life. Employers, state and local governments, businesses that are open to the public, commercial facilities, transportation, and telecommunications all have to follow the requirements of the ADA. 

<details>
  <summary>The ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability</summary>

<p>Under the ADA, it is illegal to discriminate against someone because of their disability.</p> 

<p>For example, a local rec center might only be open to people who live in the surrounding zip code. If the rec center refused access to a person with epilepsy because that person lived in a different zip code, that would not be a violation of the ADA because the rec center would not be discriminating on the basis of the person’s disability.</p>
</details> 

The ADA is broken up into five different sections, which are called titles. Different titles set out the requirements for different kinds of organizations. For example, title I of the ADA covers requirements for employers, and title II covers requirements for state and local governments. You can find the relevant title of the ADA noted next to each type of organization below. 

### Employment (Title I)

Applies to: employers that have 15 or more employees.

Note: When serving the public, all businesses, regardless of their size, must still provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to access the business’s goods and services. Read more about these requirements under the section for      Businesses that are open to the public below.

General requirement: Employers must provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from the employment-related opportunities available to others. This includes things like recruitment, hiring, promotions, training, pay, and social activities. 

If you have a complaint: File a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

>More about employers’ responsibilities:

The ADA includes specific requirements for employers to ensure that people with disabilities have equal access to employment. Learn about these requirements under the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s guidance for employers.
